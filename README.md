# Java-based Shortest Path Visualization Application

This Java-based application generates interactive HTML elements to visualize shortest path computations and related operations, offering a user-friendly interface for interacting with a backend system that calculates shortest paths between locations using graph-based algorithms in Madison.

## Features

### 1. **Shortest Path Prompt Generation**
- **Description**: Allows users to input a starting location and a destination.
- **Functionality**:
  - Generates an HTML interface with fields for the user to enter the start and end locations.
  - Includes a button to compute the shortest path between the two locations.

### 2. **Shortest Path Results Display**
- **Description**: Dynamically generates an HTML section to display the results of the shortest path computation.
- **Key Elements**:
  - Start and end locations.
  - An ordered list of locations along the computed shortest path.
  - Total travel time for the journey.
  - Error messages if no valid path exists or if input is invalid.

### 3. **Closest Destinations Prompt**
- **Description**: Provides an interface to input multiple starting locations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Facilitates the calculation of the ten closest destinations from all input locations.

### 4. **Closest Destinations Results Display**
- **Description**: Visualizes the results of the closest destination computation.
- **Key Elements**:
  - An unordered list of starting locations.
  - The most quickly reachable destination from all provided starting locations.
  - The total travel time to the closest destination.
  - Error messages for invalid inputs or computations.
